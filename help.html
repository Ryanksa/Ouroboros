    </div>
    <p>Ouroboros is a writing tool that pushes for forward thinking. Notes are comprised of lines of text entered by the user. Previously entered lines can only be changed through edit mode (see commands), and new lines simply append to the end of the note.</p>
    <p>Moreover, notes can be saved to the local database, and Ouroboros serves as a command center for retriving and editing all the saved notes.</p>
    <p>There are more features in Ouroboros to explore, such as grouping and searching the saved notes. Read on for more specific instructions.</p>

        <h1 class="header_content">How to Use</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Ouroboros seeks input from the user with "\>", where the user can type any text to enter into the current note, or enter a command to interact with the system.</p>
    <p>When a note is saved, users can set a grouping on it, which will be displayed by "[grouping}".</p>
    <p>Additionally, saved notes can be opened and/or edited, which the input seeker will be changed to "\note>" to indicate that note is currently opened.</p>
    <p>Users can also peek at saved notes' content without opening them, or search a specific text pattern through all the saved notes.</p>
    <p>See the Command section below to see everything a user can do with Ouroboros.</p>
