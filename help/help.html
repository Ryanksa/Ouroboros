    <div class="header">About</div>
    <p>Ouroboros is a writing tool that pushes for forward thinking. Unlike a standard text editor, entering new text is more accessible than editing entered text.</p>
    <p>Moreover, notes can be saved to the local database, and Ouroboros serves as a command center for retriving and editing all the saved notes.</p>
    <br/>

    <div class="header">How to Use</div>
    <p>Ouroboros seeks input from the user with "\>", where the user can type any text to enter into the current note.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, users can enter a command, by typing @command, to interact with the system.</p>
    <p>When a note is saved, users can set a grouping on it, which will be displayed by "[grouping}".</p>
    <p>Saved notes can be opened and/or edited, which the input seeker will be changed to "\note>" to indicate that note is currently opened.</p>
    <p>Users can also peek at saved notes' content without opening them, or search a specific text pattern through all the saved notes.</p>
    <p>See the Commands section below to see everything a user can do with Ouroboros.</p>
